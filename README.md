# Loan Approval Prediction

This project explores machine learning techniques to predict loan approvals based on various applicant characteristics. It serves as a practical demonstration of deploying an ML model into production, with a primary focus on understanding *packaging and distribution* strategies.

## Project Goals

Develop a robust model for loan approval prediction.
Gain hands-on experience with model deployment in a production-like environment.
Explore and implement techniques for packaging and distributing the trained model.
## Packaging and Distribution

This project leverages the standard Python packaging structure for distribution. This involves the following steps:

Creating a setup.py file: This file defines the metadata about your project, including its name, version, dependencies, and entry points (scripts or commands to be executed). You can find detailed instructions on creating setup.py in the official Python Packaging User Guide https://packaging.python.org/.

Building the distribution package: Use the python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel command to create source and wheel distribution packages. These packages can be uploaded to Python Package Index (PyPI) or a private repository for installation.
